# This is guessing a number Game
This is another game I developed. 
1 person can play against the program.
Player has 3 chances to guess a secret number between 0 and 9.
Player wins right away if gusses correctly, else requested to guess again with a hint.
Player is failed once tried 3 times unsuccussfully.
Player has an option to play again at the end of the game.
Any user input other than integer in range of 0-9 is considered invalid, and is not counted as a user guess.
